# rust-stem
I'm going to teach myself and other people STEM concepts through Rust and 3D graphics, because everything is cooler in 3D.

This is good for so many reasons, because it's going to help me understand the content even better, it gives me a reason to continue with this project, I can compile to web assembly and host it as a project on my website in the future (well I hope, I don't fully understand how web assembly works), and I can learn how to teach because I'm kind of absolutely terrible at it.
