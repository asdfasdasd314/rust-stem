Okay so I need to think about what I want to make for this project, because right now I don't where to start due to not knowing it is this project is going to be.

I know that I want to do something with a 3D character controller and procedural terrain. I think watching people play the game Rust has inspired me to make something that is perhaps similar?

I think the endgame of this project for this timespan of the hackclub highseas stuff is going to be a wilderness survival type of game. Unfortuneately I have no art skills whatsoever, so I'm gonna have to either pay someone to do it, or try to not use assets as much as possible.

I'm going to start with perlin or simplex noise (I have to research which is the right one to use) and procedural terrain.
